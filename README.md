# Java Data Structures Reference

Welcome to the **Java Data Structures Reference** repository! This project is a personal reference for various data structure implementations in Java, designed to help you get a better grasp on how to implement and use these structures effectively. I’ve made it public to share these examples as a resource for anyone looking to learn or refresh their knowledge of data structures in Java.

## 📖 Overview

This repository covers a wide range of data structures, each with its own dedicated folder and example files. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented code that demonstrates the fundamentals of each structure, along with basic operations, edge cases, and best practices.

## 🗂️ Contents

The following data structures are covered in this repository:


- **Linked Lists**: Simple Linked List Example


## 🚀 Getting Started

To use the examples in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexiwisteria/Java_DataStructures.git
cd Java_DataStructures
```

## 🧩 How to Use

- **Reference**: Use this repository as a reference for implementing various data structures from scratch.
- **Practice**: Test out each data structure and try modifying or extending them to reinforce your understanding.
- **Contribute**: Found a better way to implement something? Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.

## 💡 Key Concepts Covered

Each data structure includes the following key topics:
- Initialization and creation
- Key operations (insertion, deletion, searching)
- Common use cases
- Complexity analysis (time and space)
- Sample edge cases

## 🤝 Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, you're welcome to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions such as additional data structures, optimizations, or improved documentation are encouraged.

## 📝 License
